    <h4>Marry Me Chicken</h4>

    <p>They say the way to someone's heart is through their stomach, and this chicken dinner is worthy of a marriage proposal!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 pound bacon</li>
        <li>16oz angel hair pasta</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly shaved parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup whipping cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped sun dried tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts on a flat work surface. Slice horizontally through the middle, being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side. Open the 2 sides and spread them out like an open book to butterfly.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large, oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic, oregano, thyme. Saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add chicken and cook until golden brown but not fully cooked, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Pour 1/4 cup chicken broth into the skillet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and let cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes; chop.</li>
        <li>At the same time, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Remove skillet from the oven and transfer chicken to a plate, reserving juices in the skillet. Keep chicken warm and place skillet on the stovetop.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour into the skillet over medium heat. Add remaining chicken broth, Parmesan cheese, and whipping cream. Whisk until combined. Add sun-dried tomatoes, red pepper flakes, and salt. Add bacon and chicken back into the skillet. Serve on top of hot cooked pasta.</li>
    </ol>
